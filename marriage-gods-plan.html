    <p>If you are anything like me, you have heard your whole entire life that you need to get married and have kids because it's part of God's plan. As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, we start learning about getting married and sealed in the temple starting in primary. We are often able to say principles to live by before we even know what they mean. So, why are we asked to get married?</p>

    <p>Elder Hugh B. Brown stated: ” The family concept is one of the major and most important of the whole theological doctrine.
    
    In fact, our very concept of heaven itself is the projection of the home into eternity. Salvation, then, is essentially a family affair, and full participation in the plan of salvation can be had only in family units (1966, 103)” (Judd, 2016).</p>
    
    <p>In the world today, living together before marriage has become a normal part of life. It's no longer seen as a bad thing and a lot of people refer to marriage as just a piece of paper, but it is definitely more than that! Marriage is a sign of commitment. Not only that, but in the scriptures and the proclamation, we can see that God is literally asking us to get married and have families. A lot of people think that those commandments are outdated and no longer apply, but I have a wonder thing I like to say when I hear people say that: “God is a perfect being right? Well, would a perfect being mistakes or leave us with commandments that aren't doing to someday be valuable or valid? As someone who is married, I can definitely say that marriage is such a blessing in my life. In my heart, I know that I am following Gods plan for me.</p>
    
    <p>“President Henry B. Eyring stated, “Eternal life means to become like the Father and to live in families in happiness and joy forever” (1998, p. 10)” (Hill, 2016).</p>

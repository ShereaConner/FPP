        “Successful covenant marriages are founded on theteachings of the Lord Jesus Christ and tied to our discipleship. Elder David A. Bednar (2006, p. 86) beautifully described how being focused on Jesus in a covenant marriage relationship influences marital progress: The Lord Jesus Christ is the focal point in a covenant marriage relationship”

        “To nurture their covenant commitments to one another and God, couples will wisely make a decision to be intentionally and personally dedicated. This involves a commitment to sacrifice for and organize one’s life around the companion spouse; it also means a willingness to change any and all behaviors and attitudes for the good of the relationship. This might involve learning to resolve differences in a more healthy way, overcoming tendencies toward impatient listening, moderating unrealistic expectations, spending an evening alone together each week, or resolving personal problems”

        Marriage can be hard at times. It’s inevitable that things aren’t going to be perfect and that there are going to be bumps in the road. Arguments will arise and there will be times when you don’t agree on things.  So, what can we do? Well, it’s important to remember that you are on the same team. Instead of viewing a problem as you vs them, you should view the problem as you guys together vs the problem. I also think it’s very important to not let things fester up. If you have a problem, talk about it. Communication is one of the biggest ways to make a happy marriage. I think all couples should have the goal of never going to bed angry. As the Family Proclamation states, “Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities. By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families”

        Marriage is meant to be between a man and a woman. Research also shows that there are many benefits to being married. “An extensive body of evidence documents that married adults are clearly healthier than their non-married counterparts”

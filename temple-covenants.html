    <div class="quote">“The divine plan of happiness enables family relationships to be perpetuated beyond the grave. Sacred ordinances and covenants available in holy temples make it possible for individuals to return to the presence of God and for families to be united eternally”</div>

    <p>(This picture is of my grandparents at our family favorite temple. My grandparents were sealed in this temple, my parents were sealed in this temple, my brother and his wife were sealed in this temple, and soon my husband and I will be sealed in it.)</p>

    <p>The Promise of the Temple is blessings for your family for generations meaning the decisions you make don't only affect you, but your family. Temple covenants are also important because through these covenants' families are able to be sealed together forever. This is something that brings comfort to a lot of families because sometime the ones we love fall away. They distant themselves from God and sometimes even their families. Sometimes families are not able to see their families come back to the church in this life, but they know that their family will be blessed by the sealing power. The sealing power is something I have always loved about our church. I remember always wanted someone who would want to get be sealed to me. That honestly is the one goal I made as a kid that I have stuck to in this life. My husband is a convert to the church, and I am so excited to say we are finally going to be able to get sealed this year.</p>
    
    <p>“The Prophet Joseph Smith promised that “when a seal is put upon the father and mother, it secures their posterity, so that they cannot be lost, but will be saved by virtue of the covenant of their father and mother” (1976, p. 321)” (Pehrson, Cook, Madsen).</p>
    
    <p> I also know that through the covenants we make and the ordinances we do in the temple, great things can come to past. I am grateful for the work I have been able to do for my ancestors. </p>

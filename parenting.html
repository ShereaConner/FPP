        <h1>The Power of Parenting</h1>
        <p>“Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness, to provide for their physical and spiritual needs, to teach them to love and serve one another, to observe the commandments of God, and to be law-abiding citizens wherever they live.” (Hinkley, 1995)</p>

        <p> You always hear about the joys of parenthood, but you also hear about all the trials and tantrums you are going to have to go through. I am not yet a parent, and to be honest with you, I am super excited to be one along with being absolutely terrified of it. The picture above is of my parents. Even if we don't have parents living, or in our lives, we all have parents. Lucky for me, I have my parents and they are a part of my life. We are often told by those around us how we should parent, or what others think is right. However, the most important part though is listening to our Savior. I can't think of a better way to do that than to follow what we can learn in the Family Proclamation for the World. When we become parents, we are given the responsibility of teaching our children. </p>

<p> “Parents should never drive their children, but lead them along, giving them knowledge as their minds are prepared to receive it. Chastening may be necessary betimes, but parents should govern their children by faith rather than by the rod, leading them kindly by good example into all truth and holiness (Widtsoe, 1978, p. 208)” (Hart, Newell, Haupt, 2016).”</p>

<p> When I become a parent, I want to focus on helping my children learn how to handle their own emotions and give them knowledge to solve problems in their lives. I also want to teach them that they can rely on the gospel for anything that happens in their lives. We turn to the gospel when we are in times of need, so why not teach this to our kids from a young age? </p>

<p> “The family proclamation makes clear that Heavenly Father expects parents to have significant influence in the lives of their children. God's plan for His children may be ideally characterized as the placement of children into homes where parents are committed to their development and proclamation principles are practiced. No other arrangement is as effective, as demonstrated by the First Presidency's call to parents” (Nelson, 2016). </p>

<p> Something that brings me great comfort is that I know in me hear that God wants me to be a mother. That gives me hope that at least something will go right. It also gives me a great knowledge of how significant the role of a mother is to God. </p>

<p> “Satan has unleashed a seductive campaign to undermine the sanctity of womanhood, to deceive the daughters of God and divert them from their divine destiny. He well knows women are the compassionate, self-sacrificing, loving power that binds together the human family. . .. He has convinced many of the lie that they are third-class citizens in the kingdom of God. That falsehood has led some to trade their divinely given femininity for male coarseness (2000, p. 36). The countless acts of selfless service mothers perform are recognized as expressions of the highest love and noblest of womanly feelings (Faust, 1986). Wendell Berry (1987, p. 10)”(Erickson, 2016). </p>

<p> “Motherhood is the greatest potential influence either for good or ill in human life” (Erickson, 2016). </p>

<p> Knowing how much responsibility we have when we become mothers can be overwhelming and it's okay to feel that way. The most important thing is to trust God, and to trust that He will help you through it. You are made for this, and you are not alone.</p>
